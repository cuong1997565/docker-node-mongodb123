Failed to load the ESLint library for the document /var/www/nodejs/docker-node-mongo-todo-app/server.js

To use ESLint please install eslint by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder docker-node-mongo-todo-app
or globally using 'npm install -g eslint'. You need to reopen the workspace after installing eslint.

If you are using yarn or pnpm instead of npm set the setting `eslint.packageManager` to either `yarn` or `pnpm`
Alternatively you can disable ESLint for the workspace folder docker-node-mongo-todo-app by executing the 'Disable ESLint' command.
